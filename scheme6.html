        <div class="box">
        <p>The Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY) is a small deposit scheme by the Ministry of Finance exclusively for a girl child. SSY was launched by the Hon'ble Prime Minister on 22nd January 2015 as a part of the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao campaign. The scheme is meant to meet the education and marriage expenses of a girl child. Notified by the Government of India on 14th December 2014, this scheme encourages parents to build a fund for the future education and marriage expenses of their female child.</p>
    
        <p>One can apply for SSY through Post Offices or through the branches of Public Sector Banks and three Private Sector Banks viz. HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and ICICI Bank. The account can be opened by a parent or legal guardian of the girl child. The girl child must be below the age of 10 years. Only one account is allowed for a girl child. A family can open only two SSY accounts. The Minimum Investment is ₹250 per annum; The Maximum Investment is ₹1,50,000 per annum. The Maturity Period is 21 years. For the period 01.04.2023 to 30.06.2023, the Rate of Interest is 8.0%. The principal amount deposited, interest earned during the entire tenure, and maturity benefits are tax-exempt. The principal amount is deductible under section 80C up to ₹1,50,000.
